Q-learning algorithm is applied in two ways,
1. tabular Q-Learning
2. Deep Q-Learning

The above RL agents are being compared against another hotel with static pricing strategy.

Note: As the interpreter select the virtual environment inside the folder venv_py_310. It will take around 1-2 minutes to display all the results after simulate button is clicked in the Streamlit interface
